Hence, if you rename the courses/example/ folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within courses/example/ from [menu.example] to [menu.\u0026lt;NewFolderName\u0026gt;].\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"539a070be20f4112719fce218b48a2e4","permalink":"https://btihen.github.io/courses/robot_gardner/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/robot_gardner/","section":"courses","summary":"Sensors, electronics, and coding","tags":null,"title":"Robot Gardner","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nCrystal CLI ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"785ce6507db0a207d4f74c50cf456f88","permalink":"https://btihen.github.io/explore/crystal/cli/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/explore/crystal/cli/","section":"explore","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nCrystal CLI ","tags":null,"title":"Crystal CLI Usage","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nMint CLI ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"791d2bd259bec939ffe7881dde5108a3","permalink":"https://btihen.github.io/explore/mint/cli/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/explore/mint/cli/","section":"explore","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nMint CLI ","tags":null,"title":"Mint CLI","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b4c7f25d5b7963758e82d0980c48943b","permalink":"https://btihen.github.io/contact/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/contact/","section":"contact","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"contact"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Cultivating a sense of adventure is similar to encouraging an atmosphere of playfulness and joy of learning. This can be quite straightforward when students are allowed to create their own goals and their own context for the goals within the curriculum. Of course, any good adventure can’t be too easy. It’s the teacher’s job to make sure a project has no obvious, googleable answer.\nWe might worry that making the project hard and beyond what the students know how to do could be unfair or even unjust. This might be true. When students are used to the mindset of getting things right the first time, it is difficult for them to take an idea and ‘play’ with it until something works. This adjustment takes some time, but once they get the hang of it, students enjoy exploring and they learn quickly.\nPersonally, I most enjoy observing how students learn resilience through ‘playing’ with ideas and trying different options until they find a solution. In fact, in today’s world it may be more important to learn resilience, persistence, and finding the next small workable step in order to progress toward a goal.\nOf course creating an environment where exploration can thrive requires not doing a few things, too - such as:\n Not judging or criticizing mistakes or rework Not judging the work or its qualities, instead let the kids cultivate their own pride and ownership (the minimum quality tests need clear, objective and observable) Not celebrating the answers, but celebrating the exploratory and learning aspects. Not requiring that every student have the same depth of knowledge in each part of the project. It\u0026rsquo;s important to define baseline knowledge they all need to have - but after that they need to be free to explore more deeply what the student finds interesting.  To encourage exploration we have found that the following the guidance for a growth mindset is very helpful:\n Praise the grit and perseverance of arriving at a workable solution; Cultivate the mindset of finding the next workable thing to try, even when there is no clear path to the goal; and Encourage / expect (maybe even require) rework and changes.  On a practical note, it is important to create projects that are complex and have some built-in conflict that requires balancing and tradeoffs. This is important for several reasons:\n Without trade-offs, a problem isn’t realistic and can be too easily googled. The problem must be challenging enough or it isn’t engaging (but it needs to be workable). Having to resolve a conflict or resolve tradeoffs and still arrive at one\u0026rsquo;s goals requires students to really go into depth and learn that aspect extra well.   NOTE: In the world of engineering, it is important to have a solid generalist understanding of the field (like the basic required information tested at school), but that is rarely enough for most teams. It is important to be a specialist in at least one area of interest \u0026ndash; these are called ‘T’ shaped engineers - engineers that have gone deep into two areas are even more valuable and are called ‘π’ shaped engineers. I’m advocating for creating projects (and classroom environments) in school that cultivate the same generalist / specialist mindset that is often expected in graduate school and professional lives. Art curriculums have long taught the core skills and ideas and then expected students to explore and expand upon their interests. Imagine how engaging education could be when all aspects of schools encouraged choice and exploration.\n Teaching this way can be uncomfortable for teachers who may traditionally have felt that they need to operate as the expert who knows everything. To model the idea, however, that you don’t have to know everything, it is actually helpful not to know everything. In fact, you cannot give students a quick answer, which cuts off their chance to think through the problem, and instead you explore with the students and model how to learn and resolve difficult problems. The teacher must simply understand the basics and vocabulary of the field to help students interpret what they find. Of course the teacher must also be comfortable modeling exploring the unknown with the kids. ploring the unknown with the kids.\n","date":1590850636,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591196236,"objectID":"e653e61b72ec1522100f735fc8a59049","permalink":"https://btihen.github.io/post_edu/learning_loop_exploration/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T16:57:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/post_edu/learning_loop_exploration/","section":"post_edu","summary":"When students are trusted to explore and know that mistakes are ok, learning becomes fun and engaging.

The project-work uses many agile processes*, one step outside their knowledge/comfort,\n Agility in this context means small-teams that work with small aspects of a bigger objective and build their knowledge / project iteratively and reflect (on demo suggestions (feedback) AND their own learning process) to inform the next iteration and enjoy the exploration of knowledge.  Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Responsibilities \u0026amp; Activities  UPLIFT BUILD SUCCESS AND CONFIDENCE \u0026ndash; I personally like to borrow from the concept of the Hero\u0026rsquo;s Journey - Help the student have a context and need to learn \u0026amp; apply knowledge to the point where they can SOLVE A COMPLEX CHALLENGE to meet the goal within the context of the learning objectives of the class (or unit). Uplifted Atmosphere - guide kids to encourage strengths   re-enforce activities that builds the student\u0026rsquo;s confidence and joy in learning re-direct distracting /destructive activities toward helpful actions exploration create an atmosphere where learning can be fun, meaningful and exploratory (like young kids) and not stressful and time-based  Natural Assessment \u0026amp; Motivation - whenever possible \u0026amp; allowed - I avoid grading, assessing and correcting students. Instead, I encourage nature assessments and motivation. For example, while building boats, have a pool and criteria for \u0026ldquo;tracking\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;load\u0026rdquo;, etc. and have the students test the boat in the pool - where everyone can see and test the qualities. To that end, I find it very helpful if the students work will be publicly viewed and seen by others - preferably with the students present to \u0026ldquo;show\u0026rdquo; their product \u0026amp; experience the pride (or embarrassment in their work). That\u0026rsquo;s often much more ownership than a grade. If a state or other external final exam like an AP test is part of the course \u0026ndash; then I suggest after covering the material in the project based way \u0026ndash; then spend the last part of the class doing practice exams until the students are comfortable with the exam aspects of the knowledge. This mixed approach has been very successful in teaching AP Computer Science (nearly all students received the top score 19 of 20 students). Teaching Activities - guide kids to learn the materials (rarely instruct)   guide students to other students who can help them help the students smallify their work to find something they can research \u0026amp; solve (the next doable step just beyond their skill-level) help the students with keywords, concepts and vocabulary to do the research for their next step help the students understand and interpret their research they found but don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand help the students apply their research they\u0026rsquo;ve understood conceptually, but unsure how to implement  Student\u0026rsquo;s Responsibilities \u0026amp; Activities  Choice - of goals and context within the context of the learning objectives of the class (or unit). For example to teach middle school students 3-D Analytical Geometry \u0026amp; Fluid Dynamics - students create companies and design a boat of their choice (and print versions of it as they refine it). Each boat will need a specialty with a specialty (stability, comfort for people, speed, tracking, efficiency, load, \u0026hellip;) and can overcome some adversity (wind, waves, currents, \u0026hellip;) Context - students need to create a context they own for their chosen goal. This means creating a story (an explanation / real or imagined) for the importance of their chosen goal. For example when teaching Earth Sciences students could choose to make an Earthquake alarm system to help people in stay safe. To that end they also have to consider the consequences of their system if people rely on it - and choose at least one failure condition they can mitigate. Natural Assessment - Students need to learn to take ownership for tracking their own knowledge, resources and quality. To that end, I avoid personally telling them what to correct, instead they need to get peer-reviews, do demos and get feedback from others and assess their work against their stated goals. To that end I almost always require a public display of their work with them present. Either a presentation or demos where people come by and they demo / explain their work. I also have them practice within the class with each other - where they can see the quality and ideas of others with enough time to adjust their own work to meet their own standards or pride and avoid a sense of embarrassment (or not). Demos \u0026amp; Constructive Feedback - ideally I have the kids have a project journal and demo notes and reflections need to be recorded   Demos are IMPORTANT - putting students in the learners driver seat. Students need to learn to get / ask for (pull) their feedback to assess and adjust the quality and progress of their work (with help from the Natural Assessment as a reality check \u0026ndash; not the teacher - \u0026lsquo;What does the water say?') Students must learn to give \u0026amp; hear \u0026amp; accept feedback in their work. To that end there are 4 rules to make this work - with more experience these can be loosened some:  plan what and how to present the demo (\u0026amp; what the feedback might be - both likes and changes) present the demo \u0026amp; receiving feedback - listen \u0026amp; take notes (no challenges - keep it safe to give feedback, further explanations or clarifications of misunderstandings - simply note ones reaction and reflect on how to improve the demo - theres no problem with doing a second demo with another group if the first group didn\u0026rsquo;t understand). Giving Feedback - includes two aspects:   what is liked and how that matches what is understood about the group\u0026rsquo;s goals what they think would make the work even better (if something should change then is needs to be worded as - \u0026ldquo;I like this \u0026lsquo;pointy bow\u0026rsquo; and think it would be even better with a rounded bow\u0026rdquo;) - constructive and positive feedback (this takes practice \u0026ndash; kids (and teachers) are not well versed in \u0026ldquo;Pixar\u0026rsquo;s yes and \u0026hellip;\u0026quot; feedback process  using a suggestion each project must accept at least ONE suggestion from another group (and credit them) and explain how they made the suggestion their own and integrated it into the project. Without this - they cannot submit the project (its incomplete)!    Exploration - kids should learn to enjoy learning   DO VERY little direct instruction (if any) - have the kids explore until they get a bit stuck (but don\u0026rsquo;t make them beg for help, just be patient and help them get unstuck - DON\u0026rsquo;T TELL THEM SOLUTIONS) learning need to change (as much as possible) from an external \u0026ldquo;death march\u0026rdquo; pushed by the curriculum, but instead turned into a lean pull system by the students own needs, interests and desire to fulfill their own chosen goals within their chosen context. ideally students track what they research and learn in the project journal. Then all kids on the team have access to all the info (\u0026amp; is responsible to know what is known by others on the team - that is the homework - to know what others have done and be aware and understand it). Occasionally, I look at the journal and ask other kids in the group to explain what another has researched and if the kids doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the material then the \u0026lsquo;researcher\u0026rsquo; is responsible to ensure the others on team \u0026lsquo;catch up\u0026rsquo;  Path - The Hero\u0026rsquo;s Journey \u0026amp; Smallify - initially students are unfamilier with solving big complex problems without one clear \u0026lsquo;Googable\u0026rsquo; answer   smallify - students need to learn to find the next workable step just beyond their knowledge \u0026ndash; but doable (initially kids need help with this!) small enough - where its easy to have false starts, make lots of changes and explore and after feedback \u0026ndash; make changes without being upset at the invested time. Small enough means that it is fun to explore and make changes! Hero\u0026rsquo;s Journey - each project needs to involve complexity (that has no one right solution) but involves a complex compromise to arrive at one\u0026rsquo;s goals. This helps the students really learn the depth of the material and the compromises needed to accomplish their goals. (there have been recent studies showing that people only fully understand a topic and its related implications when they go through process of exploring complex compromises)  Reflection \u0026amp; Change   another form of reflection - done ideally daily, they asses their progress (initially I like to review their burn-down on their way out at the end of class with them and help them reflect on and verbalize what skills they are using to make progress \u0026amp; contemplate if its possible to build even more on those strengths and to reflect on whats hinder them (\u0026amp; see if they can replace that activity with something more helpful). Over time I like to encourage the kid to just update me their progress and reflections on their way out of class. students need to get regular feedback on each phase of their work (ideally at least weekly) \u0026amp; at some point each group\u0026rsquo;s project must have at least on change inspired by feedback from another group or individual outside their group - and credit that person / group.

In my case this file now looks like:\n[[main]] name = \u0026quot;Posts\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#posts\u0026quot; weight = 20 [[main]] name = \u0026quot;About\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#about\u0026quot; weight = 50 [[main]] name = \u0026quot;Contact\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#contact\u0026quot; weight = 60  These will also be the sections on the home page that will be enabled and configured.\nThe larger the weight the further to the right the item will be shown.\nstep 6: configure site parameters You may want to read through all the params - but the ones listed here are enough to get started.\n site_type \u0026ndash; in the file: config/_default/params.toml: be sure to configure the site_type variable configure \u0026lsquo;contact details\u0026rsquo;  if you choose not to add an email, then be sure to set the variable email_form=0 on the content/home/contact.md file! if you choose not to enter an address and coordinates the in the [map] section set the engine=0 to avoid problems.   configure social details \u0026ndash; optional Regional Settings \u0026ndash; NOTE: The date display settings seems to have a bug \u0026ndash; so I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend adjusting that.  step 7: configure your homepage At this point I suggest starting hugo server so you can watch your edits.\nNow go into the folder content/home and we will adjust or disable the files in this folder.\n  disable with: active=false\n  enable with: active=true\n  oder with: weight=20 the bigger the number the further down on the page is show (I suggest you use the same weights used in the menu)\n  contact.md - review and see if changes are desired.\n  accomplishments.md - (and all other home page sections you decide not to display) change active=true to active=false\n  7A: about page I prefer to use the about page when it is a person\u0026rsquo;s site and the people page when the site is about a group effort. So in this case:\nhugo new --kind authors authors/author_name  content/home/about.md\n change the title to whatever you like: biography, about, etc\u0026hellip; change the variable author to match the name you used to generate you profile above, ie:  author = \u0026quot;author_name\u0026quot;  content/authors/author_name/_index.md\n Adjust the file so the information is accurate below the --- toward the end of the file, add your own free text to the about page.  content/authors/author_name/avatar.jpeg (png, jpg, etc also work)\n add an attractive image to the folder content/authors/author_name/ and name it: avatar.jpg  7B: people (or Team) page disable content/home/about.md\n Mark the active variable as false:  active=false  enable content/home/people.md\n set active=true create sub-group names:  [content] user_groups = [\u0026quot;Educators\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Researchers\u0026quot;]  or alternatively, use an empty string to create a team without sub-teams:\n[content] user_groups = [\u0026quot;\u0026quot;]  Create the people (authors)\nhugo new --kind authors authors/person_name  content/authors/person_name/_index.md\n add one (or more) user_group to the person\u0026rsquo;s profile using the user_groups variable:  user_groups = [\u0026quot;Educators\u0026quot;]  if you used an empty string in people.md add:\nuser_groups = [\u0026quot;\u0026quot;]   Edit this file so that the information is accurate below the --- toward the end of the file, add your own free text to the about page.  content/authors/person_name/avatar.jpeg (png, jpg, etc also work)\n add an attractive image to the folder content/authors/person_name/ and name it: avatar.jpg  step 8: Test publish to username.github.io When you site is good enough to publish then its time to follow the following steps (these MUST be done in order to prevent problems!)\n8A: public folder (non-existent) The first time you do setup for publishing it is important this folder doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist yet and that public isn\u0026rsquo;t listed in the .gitignore` file\n8B: git snapshot (DO NOT YET GENERATE your website)\nCreate your git snapshot (very important at this point since the next steps are tricky)\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;First draft of homepage\u0026quot; git push  8C: make second github repo username.github.io Now make a second public repo (CLICK THE BOX TO INCLUDE A README and/or a LISENCE file!) on github called username.github.io, this MUST be exactly: username.github.io for this to work!\nDouble check your repo is not empty, but has a README and/or a LISENCE file.\nNOW go to github repo settings and click on manage access and be sure you have permission to at administer (or at least write to this repo) \u0026ndash; probably not so click the invite teams or people button and add yourself as an admin (an other as needed).\n8D: clone username.github.io to public (within your Hugo project) now go back into your website code (root folder) and type:\ngit clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git public  if you see: warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository. \u0026ndash; go back to the repo and create a README file!\n8E: check your permissions enter you public folder and create an index.html file and put in very simple html code: \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello username.github.io\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\ncd public touch index.html echo '\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello username.github.io\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; index.html  now check this in and push it to github.\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;test webpage\u0026quot; git push  At this point you should see a bunch of message and toward the end you should see a line with:\nTo github.com:username/username.github.io.git  If instead you get the error:\nremote: Permission to peakchallenges/peakchallenges.github.io.git denied to btihen. fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/peakchallenges/peakchallenges.github.io.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403  go back and check your site permissions.\nIf site permissions aren\u0026rsquo;t a problem do the following:\nre-create your website repo username.github.io.git outside the webcode project.\ngit clone git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git cd username.github.io echo '\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello username.github.io - v1\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; index.html git add index.html git commit -m \u0026quot;update readme and test permissions\u0026quot; git push  assuming this works then move this repo into the hugo repo:\nrm -rf username_website/public mv username.github.io username_website/public cd username_website/public echo '\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello username.github.io - v2\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; index.html git commit -am \u0026quot;update readme and test permissions within hugo project\u0026quot; git push  8F: check the website Wait a few minutes and go to the website https://username.github.io and be sure you see your newly published html page.\nstep 9: configure public as a submodule Now add the username.github.io repo as a submodule to your website code repo using. This allows nested projects without confusing git.\nFirst be sure you are in the hugo root and not the public folder and type:\ncd public git submodule add -b master https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git public`  now in .git/modules you might see a folder called public (with a bunch of stuff in it) if not simply edit your .git/config so that after:\n[submodule \u0026quot;themes/academic\u0026quot;] path = themes/academic url = https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic.git  you see:\n[submodule \u0026quot;public\u0026quot;] path = public url = https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git branch = master  You can add it by hand or with:\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026quot;EOF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; git/config [submodule \u0026quot;public\u0026quot;] path = public url = https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git branch = master EOF  step 10: publish your new Hugo webpage: Now to publish the Hugo site you prepared do the following:\nhugo -d public cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;first webpage content\u0026quot; git push # toward the end you should see: `To github.com:username/username.github.io.git` cd ..  Follow this proceedure every time you update your site.\nNOTE: BE SURE NOT TO delete the folder public/.git/ or you will need to reconfigure your public submodule.\nnow go back to https://username.github.io and you should see your hugo site!\n(This might take a few minutes \u0026ndash; up to a half-hour \u0026ndash; to publish)\n","date":1589618361,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590223161,"objectID":"1f82a1473eb178acbf4c24d93cf6b5f2","permalink":"https://btihen.github.io/post_tech/hugo_academic_website_steps/","publishdate":"2020-05-16T10:39:21+02:00","relpermalink":"/post_tech/hugo_academic_website_steps/","section":"post_tech","summary":"hugo web (with the Academic Theme) and using git submodules and github to publish a free website","tags":["Hugo","Static Site","git","submodules"],"title":"Hugo Website using Github","type":"post_tech"},{"authors":["Bill Tihen"],"categories":["Code"],"content":"Intro It is often helpful to be able to test email sending from an application during development or testing (or even to make testing emails on a staging server possible).\nTo do this follow these instructions for a safe convenient way to test and inspect emails sent from an application.\nSETUP First we need to get the repo (or at least the docker file)\n# get the mailcatcher repo git clone git@github.com:sj26/mailcatcher.git # go into mailcather repo cd mailcatcher # configure to use the newest `released` gem version of mailcatcher sed -i.bu1 's/FROM ruby:2.5/FROM ruby:2.6/' Dockerfile sed -i.bu2 's/ARG VERSION=0.6.5/ARG VERSION=0.7.1/' Dockerfile  The Dockerfile should now look like (which is actually all that is actually needed):\nFROM ruby:2.6 MAINTAINER Samuel Cochran \u0026lt;sj26@sj26.com\u0026gt; ARG VERSION=0.7.1 RUN gem install mailcatcher -v $VERSION EXPOSE 1025 1080 ENTRYPOINT [\u0026quot;mailcatcher\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;--foreground\u0026quot;] CMD [\u0026quot;--ip\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;0.0.0.0\u0026quot;]  BUILD IMAGE Now you can download the docker image and install the gems into it with:\n# -t adds repository:tag info -- the '.' at the end is important: docker build -t btihen/ruby/mailcatcher:ruby_2.6 . # ... # should end with something like # Successfully built 21e0de2bdd68 # now tag it as the **lasted** image with: docker build -t btihen/ruby/mailcatcher:latest .  now you can see your list of docker images (you should see the starting image/container we just created):\ndocker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE btihen/ruby/mailcatcher latest 21e0de2bdd68 8 minutes ago 870MB btihen/ruby/mailcatcher ruby_2.6 21e0de2bdd68 8 minutes ago 870MB ruby 2.6 a98425292e84 2 weeks ago 843MB  BUILD CONTAINER Now start the docker image using the build image id (-d allows it to run in the backgroud, -p 1025:1025 -p 1080:1080 opens a connection on ports 1025 \u0026amp; 1080 from localhost to the docker image):\n# build a container so we can test our image docker run -d -p 1025:1025 -p 1080:1080 --name mailcatcher btihen/ruby/mailcatcher:latest # or if you like ids better docker run -d -p 1025:1025 -p 1080:1080 --name mailcatcher 21e0de2bdd68 # if you forgot the image-id you can list the images with: docker images  TESTING (http \u0026amp; smtp) now you should be able to go to http://localhost:1080 and see the mailcatcher webpage.\nnow lets test the smtp side from the cli using these instructions: https://www.shellhacks.com/send-email-smtp-server-command-line/\n# connect to the mail server $ telnet localhost 1025 # or $ telnet 127.0.0.1 1025 220 smtp.domain.ext ESMTP Sendmail ?version-number?; ?date+time+gmtoffset? # declare yourself (IP or DNS) \u0026gt; HELO local.domain.name 250 smtp.domain.ext Hello local.domain.name [xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx], pleased to meet you # declare who the email is from: \u0026gt; MAIL FROM: test@local.domain.name 250 2.1.0 sender@adress.ext...

This is what follows.\nNOTE: Since I am just learning the Phoenix Framework and will need to refer to this for my self to remember how to do basic things \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ve documented every little detail.\nStep 0 - setup environment Setup environment \u0026amp; newest version of elixir:\nexenv install 1.10.3 exenv global exenv local 1.10.3  Install the 1.5.1 phx_new generator:\nmix archive.install hex phx_new 1.5.1\nStep 1: Create a Phoenix Project with LiveView Create the project (notice the --live - that enables LiveView, --no-ecto - keeps the project smaller since we won\u0026rsquo;t be persisting any data):\nmix phx.new counter --no-ecto --live\nenter project and create init commit:\ncd counter git init \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git add -A \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -m \u0026quot;init\u0026quot;  Step 2 - simple counter page using LiveView Make a counter_live folder \u0026amp; an index.ex file:\nmkdir lib/counter_web/live/counter_live touch lib/counter_web/live/counter_live/index.ex  Add the following contents: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49  # lib/counter_web/live/counter_live/index.ex defmodule CounterWeb.CounterLive.Index do use CounterWeb, :live_view # since we don\u0026#39;t have a db to pull from we initialize on mount @impl true def mount(_params, _session, socket) do {:ok, assign(socket, :val, 0)} end def render(assigns) do ~L\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Live Counter\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Here is a great complex page\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;The count is: \u0026lt;%= @val %\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;dec\u0026#34;\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;inc\u0026#34;\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;clear\u0026#34;\u0026gt;clear\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;even more awesome content\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; end # event handler for \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;inc\u0026#34;\u0026gt; def handle_event(\u0026#34;inc\u0026#34;, _, socket) do {:noreply, update(socket, :val, \u0026amp;(\u0026amp;1 + 1))} end # event handler for \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;dec\u0026#34;\u0026gt; def handle_event(\u0026#34;dec\u0026#34;, _, socket) do {:noreply, update(socket, :val, \u0026amp;(\u0026amp;1 - 1))} end # event handler for \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;clear\u0026#34;\u0026gt; def handle_event(\u0026#34;clear\u0026#34;, _, socket) do {:noreply, update(socket, :val, \u0026amp;(\u0026amp;1 - \u0026amp;1))} # {:noreply, update(socket, :val, 0)} # very slow - why? end end  \nNow update the routers (so we can get to the new webpage \u0026ndash; now our app should work: 1 2 3 4 5 6  scope \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, CounterWeb do pipe_through :browser # live \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, PageLive, :index # remove this line live \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, CounterLive.Index, :index # add this line end  \nStart pheonix:\nmix phx.server\nGo to:\nlocalhost:4000\nYou should now see the website and the counter should function\nAssuming all is good, I\u0026rsquo;ll take a git snapshot:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;counter with live update\u0026quot;  Step 3 - Running tests In order to run the tests we type:\nmix test  We see that PageLive test fails. This is because we replaced this behavior with CounterLive\nTo fix this we will create a CounterLive test and delete PageLive test.\nrm test/counter_web/live/page_live_text.exs touch test/counter_web/live/counter_live_text.exs  Here is the code for our new test: it basically just checks to be sure our Title is on the page: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  # test/counter_web/live/counter_live_text.exs defmodule CounterWeb.CounterLiveTest do use CounterWeb.ConnCase import CounterWeb.CounterLive.Index test \u0026#34;disconnected and connected render\u0026#34;, %{conn: conn} do {:ok, page_live, disconnected_html} = live(conn, \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) assert disconnected_html =~ \u0026#34;Live Counter\u0026#34; assert render(page_live) =~ \u0026#34;Live Counter\u0026#34; end end  \nNow we can test again: mix test\nNow that works, lets take another git snapshot:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;counter with live update\u0026quot;  Step 4 \u0026ndash; LiveView Templates Create a template file (helpful for complex html pages, but simple to create):\ntouch lib/counter_web/live/counter_live/index.html.leex\nNow just copy the html (from the render method into this file):\n# lib/counter_web/live/counter_live/index.html.leex \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Live Counter\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Here is a great complex page\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;The count is: \u0026lt;%= @val %\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;dec\u0026#34;\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;inc\u0026#34;\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;clear\u0026#34;\u0026gt;clear\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;even more awesome content\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; Now point lib/counter_web/live/counter_live/index.ex to this file by replacing render with an apply command:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  # add this new function defp apply_action(socket, :index, _params) do socket end # remove this funtion # def render(assigns) do # ~L\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # ... # \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # end   NOTE: apply_action understands the rest verbs such as :new, :show etc.\nNow try the app again and it should still work!\nAssuming it still works, I\u0026rsquo;ll take another git snapshot:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;counter using a template\u0026quot;  Step 5 - Reusable Components (\u0026amp; isolation) This allows complex components to be reused within multiple templates and isolation to keep one\u0026rsquo;s mental scope minimal.\nCreate a file for the component:\ntouch lib/counter_web/live/counter_live/counter_component.ex\nMove the dynamic html and it\u0026rsquo;s associated functions into this file, it\u0026rsquo;s important to import the live_components into this file using:\nuse CounterWeb, :live_component\nIn order to encapsulate the events into the component we will also move the event handlers into the component file.\nSo this file will now look like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  # lib/counter_web/live/counter_live/counter_component.ex defmodule CounterWeb.CounterLive.CounterComponent do use CounterWeb, :live_component def render(assigns) do ~L\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;The count is: \u0026lt;%= @val %\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;dec\u0026#34; phx-target=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;%= @myself %\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;inc\u0026#34; phx-target=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;%= @myself %\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026#34;clear\u0026#34; phx-target=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;%= @myself %\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;clear\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; end def handle_event(\u0026#34;inc\u0026#34;, _, socket) do {:noreply, update(socket, :val, \u0026amp;(\u0026amp;1 + 1))} end def handle_event(\u0026#34;dec\u0026#34;, _, socket) do {:noreply, update(socket, :val, \u0026amp;(\u0026amp;1 - 1))} end def handle_event(\u0026#34;clear\u0026#34;, _, socket) do # {:noreply, update(socket, :val, 0)} # very slow - why? {:noreply, update(socket, :val, \u0026amp;(\u0026amp;1 - \u0026amp;1))} end end  \nNotice the button tags are slightly more complex\n\u0026lt;button phx-click=\u0026quot;dec\u0026quot; phx-target=\u0026quot;\u0026lt;%= @myself %\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nthe @myself basically informs the event that the handler is within the component.\nNow update the live template to point at the component using:\n\u0026lt;%= live_component @socket, CounterWeb.CounterLive.CounterComponent, id: 0, val: @val %\u0026gt;\nAlso note we need to pass the @val value into the component using:\nid: 0, val: @val\nits a little wierd, but we need to pass an id even if there is no ecto backed record.\nNow the template file looks like a normal template file again (focused on formating):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26  # lib/counter_web/live/counter_live/index.ex defmodule CounterWeb.CounterLive.Index do use CounterWeb, :live_view # since we don\u0026#39;t have a db to pull from we initialize on mount @impl true def mount(_params, _session, socket) do {:ok, assign(socket, :val, 0)} end def render(assigns) do ~L\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Live Counter\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Here is a great complex page\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;%= live_component @socket, CounterWeb.CounterLive.CounterComponent, id: 0, val: @val %\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;even more awesome content\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; end end   Lets check that this still works.\nAssuming it still works, I\u0026rsquo;ll make one last git snapshot:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;live pages using isolated components - like JS does\u0026quot;  ","date":1589122913,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589122913,"objectID":"7f01d28a66b59e7ec8ae57f0f1e0ce0f","permalink":"https://btihen.github.io/post_tech/phoenix_1_5_live_view_basics/","publishdate":"2020-05-10T17:01:53+02:00","relpermalink":"/post_tech/phoenix_1_5_live_view_basics/","section":"post_tech","summary":"Create a simple web counter app to learn how Phoenix 1.5 LiveView works.

Many people find this helpful way to to show yourself, your parents and teachers what work needs to be done. Ideally, this is done on a large screen, sheet of paper, or whiteboard - so that it is obvious and easily seen as a reminder.\nStatus Tracking The simplest statuses would be: To-Do, Doing, Done\n-- Some teacher often require a draft Review before final submissions, engineers use a similar column Review or Demo. Generally, this is a good idea to check your work with peers, parents or your teacher before handing in your work \u0026ndash; so we suggest a Review column before done. So now the statuses would be:\nTo-Do, Doing, Review, Done\n-- Swim-lanes (tracking multiple classes / projects) Ideally when using this technique you keep the number of simultaneous tasks (WIP) to a minimum\n The number of simultaneous tasks is called work-in-progress or abbreviated as WIP\n Education, unfortunately, expects a lot of simultaneous tasks within a variety of classes. To address this we can use swim-lanes to track our priorities with a jumble of independent projects (classes). For example: we might have swim-lanes for: English, Mathematics, Science, \u0026hellip;\nIdeally, we will try only allow ONE task in your doing and review boxes for each swim-lane / class. (This is called a WIP Limit of 1).\nTasks Tasks Cards should have critical reminder information on them. Refrain from putting extra information on the card, the card should be clean and simple to read - it is a reminder of work to do NOT a full description of the assignment.\nHere is the critical information I include on a personal Kanban card.\n Title - Big bold text (upper left corner) Description - a very short reminder of what to do - ideally in 4 to 5 words Class - in case of confusion, I write the class / swim-lane (lower left corner) Due Date - Big bold Text (lower right corner) Start Date - use this to schedule small tasks of a large project - which can be used to slowly make progress on a large task (I call this smallifying). This is a very important skill to ensure continued progress on large projects in a timely way. I put this just above the Due Date  Here is an example of a Kanban in use with tasks:\nUsage I like to use A3 paper and small post-it notes to add tasks. Here is our recommended blank Kanban - where you can write in your classes. Put your most important classes (in the IB these would be your High Level courses) at the top. Use a timebox on long tasks that need to move forward, but are too big to do in one work session \u0026ndash; this is especially important when you have multiple tasks that need to be accomplished on a give day.\n Timebox - is a time limit that you won\u0026rsquo;t exceed for a given tasks in order to keep all tasks on schedule. We suggest 25 to 35 minute timeboxes with small 5 minute breaks between tasks. Every 4 timeboxes take a longer 15 minute break. This is called the pomodoro technique for full details.\n   To best use a Kanban board, you should follow the following ritual:\n Prioritize your work \u0026ndash; when you sit down to work, spend the first 5 minutes reviewing the Kanban board:   First assess what in the priority classes needs to be done in order meet assignment deadlines (for long tasks set a timebox so you make progress but can keep all your other tasks moving too) Second assess what needs to be started in priority classes to stay on track with larger projects. If you already have a task in that classes doing box then schedule that task to be done ASAP so that you can start the next task. This is important a common Kanban saying is:_ **START FINISHING TASKS, stop starting unfinished tasks!**   Do your work \u0026ndash; respect your priorities and your timeboxes!\n  UPDATE YOUR KANBAN - End five to ten minutes before your time is up (set an alarm if needed) and update your tasks to their new status boxes. If you couldn\u0026rsquo;t meet your goals for a task put a smaller colorful post-it on it - as an ALERT.\n  Address the needs of problem tasks \u0026ndash; for all tasks with an ALERT: write emails to get help, or make notes on research needed to do make progress on problem tasks.\n  REFLECT \u0026ndash; Assess what is going well and consider if doing more that will help you be more successful and assess what is hindering you and what you can do differently to get you work done with less stress. You reflections should result in actions (experiments for a week or so) to help you move more effectively toward your goals. If your experiment doesn\u0026rsquo;t help, they after the test period try a new experiment.\n   NOTE: Dead person activities are actions that even a dead person can successfully do. For example, waiting for someone else to help, not checking twitter in homework time, etc. Live person activities are action that only live people can successfully accomplish. For example, ask a peer for help, research on the Internet for ideas, go to a help session, replace random twitter checks with Pomodoro Technique (and allow twitter in the 5 minute breaks), etc.\n References Kanban  https://www.personalkanban.com/ https://moduscooperandi.com/books-and-classes  Pomodoro  https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFW3Ld7JO0w  Helpful Books Kanban - Task Management\n Real-World Kanban: Do Less, Accomplish More with Lean Thinking, by Mattias Skarin.
