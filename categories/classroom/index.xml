      <title>The Hero&#39;s Journey</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgilty_btihen_heros_journey/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stories, especially a Hero’s Journey, have a long and successful track record of creating engaging stories, movies, and, more recently, captivating ad campaigns for marketers and business executives. For several reasons, I also argue that the Hero’s Journey is very helpful in a learning context - especially if the students themselves are the authors of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, stories allow students a variety of ways to engage with curriculum goals. I generally like to have students create a story related to the unit, giving them just enough guidelines to ensure a good challenge, while still clearly seeing if they have accomplished the goal, all without falling back on the teacher’s opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I start with a statement For example, when creating a unit on biology and robotics, the goal was to have the students create a robot that would keep their plants alive over a two week vacation. If the robot fails, the garden dies. Or in a boat design / physics class, students were to design a boat that met at least one of three prescribed qualities and could survive at least one of three prescribed nautical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step is to have the students define a “future” or “imaginary” persona and a goal or reason that this persona is doing the project. I have them document their persona, since at the end of the project, they will present their story using that persona. Students are allowed to adjust their persona and goal as they progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once students have chosen a persona, goal and purpose, they start the actual work on their project. At this point, most students are quite engaged since they have picked some aspect of the project that interests them and have found a way that the project and materials relate to their own world. By developing a purpose in the context of the story, they are more likely to be successful when they encounter the “challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am careful to design the projects so that there is no perfect solution and the projects represent a significant challenge. It is important that the students need to think through and explore several aspects of the topic to understand, in their opinion, the best way forward. Of course, it is important to make the whole endeavor doable. Like a good game, it starts off easy and gets progressively harder, building skills as the game - the story - progress. It helps to keep the students focused on the next immediate doable aspect of the project, while keeping an eye on moving toward their goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the project gets more challenging and students are working toward the “impossible” perfection they seem to desire, it is important to be patient and supportive. When students struggle, they are learning. When they have to make difficult compromises to best arrive at their goal, or an acceptable variation of the goal, they are learning. Messy is how learning is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way I have found to help the students, in addition to observing and guiding them during class, is to regularly review student progress with them, reflecting together on their progress. What about their work is effective? What could they try to be even more effective? What, indeed, does effective mean - to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is to have the students present their purpose, personas, goal, and project. In short, their heroic journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly compare the above project flow to an Agile process, including the kickoff, consider these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kickoff meeting (define the goals and roles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily Standups &amp;amp; other Scrum activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External Scrum demo &amp;amp; Review of feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprint Retrospective (reflecting on what can be even better)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Feedback: It&#39;s Not what You Think</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/explore_uplift_feedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 01:16:20 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://btihen.me/post_edu/explore_uplift_feedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do what I can to create an environment where students can learn as much as possible both independently and from each other collaboratively. This has two large impacts. First, as a teacher I am mostly removed from continually correcting students. Second, as a teacher I have time to coach and guide the students when they need help and guidance, in a manner they are asking for. Teaching is much more joyful when you aren’t continually in a position of correcting  and judging what is right. The classroom atmosphere is positively impacted as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote independent learning I do what I can to create learning situations (and projects) where &lt;strong&gt;natural&lt;/strong&gt; feedback is integral to the learning process. Natural feedback comes about in circumstances where the student work itself produces the feedback with no dependence on the teacher. For example, while learning about designing boats, if students are printing their designs on a 3D printer, the students themselves will see how their boats float and how they react to adverse conditions, for example waves and wind. If the assignment asks students to test their boats by setting up a fan to blow across the test pool, they will see if their boat can travel across the pool without hitting the side wall or foundering. Or in math and physics students can do what we call sanity checks. Are their calculations plausible? Learning the skill of creating and learning from feedback that you control yourself is a transferable, life-worthy skill, that goes beyond the particular content of an activity or course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote collaborative learning, I help students learn how to support each other by giving feedback that is easy to digest. Instead of promoting correction, I ask students to follow the Pixar &lt;strong&gt;additive&lt;/strong&gt; feedback method (see the resources at the end for further information). In short, I have the following demo or presentation rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;feedback giver&lt;/strong&gt;: 1) stop and think, then 2) start with what you like and 3) say what you would like to see more of. There is no corrective feedback or discussions of what you dislike. Students (and the teacher) just offer what they would like to see more of. It’s ok, of course, if that feedback excludes some of what’s there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;demo presenter&lt;/strong&gt;: 1) listen and 2) do not comment or or mount a defense to what you are hearing, but clarification questions are allowed and encouraged. After the demo, (3) stop and think; then (4) decide what suggestions to act upon and what not to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students (and many teachers) are not very practiced at Pixar’s &lt;strong&gt;additive feedback&lt;/strong&gt;, so practice is practice is essential.  In fact, initially I guide all demos to ensure they learn the practices to feel safe while demoing, giving and getting additive feedback.  After demos I do a quick reflection with the group to help them think through what ideas to use and what to disregard.  Over time, the students get good at this and I no longer guide the demos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; feedback isn&amp;rsquo;t easy or when working with technical topics where there are multiple ways to solve a problem and when judgement is important. Then instead of emphasizing &amp;lsquo;additive&amp;rsquo; feedback, I turn to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.michaelagreiler.com/about/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Michaela Greiler (Doctor McKayla)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;code review guidelines&lt;/strong&gt; in her video

She developed these guidelines while working at Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Research and Development Department while studying the effects of code reviews and feedback on team performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I avoid the phrase &amp;ldquo;constructive feedback,&amp;rdquo; since that phrase is too often code for stating what you personally think is correct. When the teacher does that, from the position of power granted to teachers by way of assigning grades, for example, constructive feedback becomes another way to tell students what is right (according to the teacher) and what students should do. Encouraging additive feedback puts the focus on what the student is learning, not what the teacher is thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that collaborative feedback is practiced I require every project to include at least one adjustment that students must credit to another student’s feedback when they hand-in or present their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technology companies focus on communication and feedback to create an environment of enthusiastic, engaged learners.  Fundamentally, they are moving away from an &amp;lsquo;authoritative&amp;rsquo;,  &amp;lsquo;telling&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;corrective&amp;rsquo; approach and instead toward an &amp;lsquo;amplifying&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;curious&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;collaborative&amp;rsquo; approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflection: The Key to Adaptability</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_reflection/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 01:16:28 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_reflection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptability is the key or maybe even the definition of agility, as discussed in Paul’s article 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://btihen.me/blog/edgility_pmagnuson_adaptability&#34;&gt;Adaptability article&lt;/a&gt;. In this article I’ll discuss how I try to instill adaptability as a classroom process for student learning. These practices are borrowed from tech companies and business consultants, but I am confident they can be applied in many contexts, including education, when properly adapted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first taught, I only led reflections at the end of a learning unit or project and I encouraged the students to think deeply and go into detail. However, I realized that students have little practice with reflecting on their learning process, making a deep retrospective impractical. Additionally, I encourage an exploratory approach in class, where the student goal purposely doesn’t align with easy-to-google solutions, so students need to learn and adapt as they go. It turns out students generally have little practice adapting as they go, perhaps because the learning path is too easy, or too clean. Thus even project work doesn’t usually involve deep thinking, thoughtful decisions, and compromises to accomplish their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to introduce mini-reflections at the end of each class and then ask what, if anything, students would do differently in the next class. I ask one or two questions, usually from this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your goal next class?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What/who is allowing you to progress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What/who could help you progress with the next goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s slowing you down?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What obstacles are blocking your progress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can you adjust, change or do more of to enjoy progress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mini-retrospectives last about a minute or so and happen on the way out of the class. Teachers will recognize the format as “exit tickets” or “pro-formas.” Because I taught engineering topics and students work in small groups of three to four, the process only takes about vie minutes and is integrated into the cleanup process. (Students are very good about getting started and being engaged - but cleanup seems to be easier to forget somehow. Those who are quicker to catch on do their mini-retrospective first). When the students have to return materials and clear their bench, I look at their work (their lab book and project) as they describe it and we jointly update their burn-down chart (an Agile progress tracking-tool &amp;amp; future blog-post) &lt;strong&gt;Importantly, I always ask what went well and how they can maintain and enjoy their progress.&lt;/strong&gt; If needed, I might also ask what they test to get unstuck, to catch up, etc.  Finally, I ask what they have in mind for the next class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very quick and neutral discussions that give the students practice reflecting and being asked how they will adjust in a very low-stakes environment. This seems to be exactly the practice many students need. It also turns out that many students enjoy showing off their work at the end of each class. &lt;strong&gt;These are not corrective or judgmental teacher lead meetings, but rather quick coaching and check-ins - with the goal of guiding students to self-reflect and self-regulate. This approach can be uplifting and cultivate student confidence and appreciation for learning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s research that shows positive interactions lead to positive outcomes - perhaps unsurprisingly - and plenty of reasons to build a sense of uplift into the teaching and learning environment. Uplift is also a practice of EDgility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once every week or so I meet with each student group during class and do a five-minute reflection (still short, but more in-depth than the one-minute check-ins) and we review more questions.  This more in-depth reflection also seems to be important and is where students really start to cultivate confidence in their self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These many small reflections encourage adaptability. With time students get good at reflection and self-regulation. At this point the students are ready to guide their reflections and self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once students have gotten to the point where they are self-reflecting and self-correcting, the students are well on their way with an Agile-Mindset and as self-regulated learners! In my mind, this is a very life-worthy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Be prepared to be flexible and work with each group differently to meet their needs, different students and groups take longer or shorter to self-reflect and self-regulate. Creating a safe environment where exploration, success and progress are called out and celebrated - is critical, the students have plenty of other classes where correction and short-comings as seen by others (usually the teacher) is called out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Value: Motivation and Knowledge with a Context</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_value/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 14:05:18 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_value/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to find ways to make the topic of study valuable - not to me, but to the students. I actually usually find that value requires a context or integration. If an engineer builds a more efficient transport boat, but the boat regularly sinks when sailing in wind, then the boat has little value despite its newly engineered efficiency. Similarly, student learning proceeds with value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I have found students will cultivate their own value when they have a choice in how they approach and apply the learning associated with a subject. In particular, students will find value when they can define their own goal consistent with the class agenda and ideally within a context that is valuable or interesting to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I encourage students to pick their own learning goals within the open guidelines of the class. I generally ask them to choose their own backstory and context for each subject. For many teachers - and possibly for you, the readers - this may sound silly or like a waste of time. However, creating a backstory and context has many beneficial side effects: a) students have a goal that they chose themselves; b) students have their own context - many teenagers seem to enjoy creating a new experimental identity); and c) students research the broad aspects of a topic and to figure out what is most important in the areas that they find attractive. At this point, assuming the students have the feeling that they will be supported and can accomplish their goal, they have acquired their own value and context for the material and the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This startup process includes the students learning some background about what they are learning without violating the principle of “cooking from day one.” Teenagers, if not overwhelmed by the idea, enjoy picking their own goals and exercising their indepence. As teachers, it is important to be flexible enough to allow goals that might be outside our teacher expectations, especially if the outcomes are valuable and still fit, perhaps more widely interpreted, with the learning goals of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, startup with choice is not quite enough. It’s not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students must go deep enough in a subject so that they discover viable, but  competing, answers to the problems they are working on, so that they can explain why their solutions are defendable within their chosen context. For example, while collaborating with a biology teacher, we decided to combine biology and robotics and have the students build their own mini-robot gardeners to care for their plants over a three week holiday. A few students chose what they believed was the best watering strategy, but they didn’t anticipate that the cleaning staff would  move their equipment during the break. The ensuing jiggling dislodged a few sensors, and some plants were flooded with water and drowned. Upon return they learned that “best” is only best if it includes planning for failures. We could have explained planning for failure to the students, but the natural consequences of a flood was a much better teacher and the real world consequences much more memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it is important to help ensure that students learn within a context with enough complexity so they learn to choose between multiple possible answers that will each have different strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many students are not yet accustomed to the expectation of learning enough about a topic so that they understand its complexity and the context for when it is valuable and when it is not. Therefore, initially, it is usually helpful to have them work through small challenges in a supportive, low risk situation where mistakes and exploration is safe and expected. This creates an uplifting environment where learning is enjoyable and self-motivating. Without uplift, the engagement of value and self-motivation is challenging and the need for judgement increases (and starts a vicious cycle). See the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://peakchallenges.ch/blog/edgility_pmagnuson_uplift&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Uplift blog&lt;/a&gt; for a further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depth of knowledge gained when students choose between viable alternatives they have discovered themselves seems surprisingly under-emphasized in schools, since in the professional world this is a basic expectation. We expect our bridges and buildings to do well in earthquakes, high winds, and high water while they also serve our daily needs well. We expect doctors to advise us or pick the best medication, based on our age, sickness, our expectation of quality of life during treatment. We can perhaps leverage value to expect more of our students, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning value within a context is a very important life skill - not just an important academic skill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Smallify to Learn Effectively</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_smallify/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 14:05:38 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_smallify/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://peakchallenges.ch/blog/edgility_pmagnuson_transparency&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Transparency article&lt;/a&gt;, there is an important interaction between having the “big picture” (having a goal and some expectations along the way) and knowing “what to do next” (a feeling of workability and progress). This article explores how to establish both by creating an effective self-guided learning strategy for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In EDgility we encourage student self-determination. Student choice and understanding the big picture are critical components to cultivate self-determination. They need to understand the big picture in order to exercise real choice. To support them, I like to offer students projects with broad goals. The big general goal starts the process of smallifying, because they will have to smallify in order to make progress. The students first explore the field just enough to find ideas that interest them, to pick their own specific goal, and to find a purpose or context for that goal.  It is important at this stage that the student’s goals already include a complication / design compromise consistent with the overall goal. For example, students may choose to build a cargo boat that saves energy, but it must also be stable in waves. Commercially, their boat is only better if it is effective at the overall goal (staying afloat) and good at a new specific goal (saving energy). Students must think broadly and understand the context of their project in actual use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first step generally creates a lot of enthusiasm (and ideas) as the students create a storyline, a new identity, and an organization to support their mission. The story line and organization need to be attractive to them and others, both to support their motivation and to make for a good sales pitch at the end of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two classes that started with big goals that required smallifying into many workable steps were the “Boat Design” and “Robot Gardeners” classes.  I’ve written about those elsewhere, see e.g. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://btihen.me/publication/ecis_designed_to_float_your_boat_article/&#34;&gt;boat design in ECIS Global Insights&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://btihen.me/publication/las_spotlight_robot_gardener/&#34;&gt;Robot Gardeners in Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in smallifying is for the students to figure out the most important aspects needed to accomplish the big goals. I call this &lt;strong&gt;distilling&lt;/strong&gt; the essence of the topic in relation to their goal. For example, in the boat design class, all boat designs must understand buoyancy (flotation), and depending on the boat specialty and safety features, two or three other concepts will be important, i.e., students who choose to build a speedboat will need excellent fluid efficiency and perhaps also stability while turning. Learning to discover the important aspects of a large complex field and to find the critical aspects relating to one’s goals is an important life skill in almost all aspects of life. It is, in fact, a skill that transcends the specific content of the class - and therefore lifeworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give the students only a short amount of time to do these first two steps (perhaps one or two classes total). This prevents analysis paralysis. Besides, not having time to fully understand a field before starting gives the students permission to adjust as they explore their topic. Learning to manage and adjust projects as you learn and progress is known as &lt;strong&gt;agile management&lt;/strong&gt; - another useful life-skill in our quickly evolving world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the students start the iterative smallification of concrete actionable steps to learn and progress toward the goal. These small steps are exploratory and safe. Safe means that the step is small enough that it isn’t upsetting if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on the first try and safe means that the teacher is neutral about successful and unsuccessful steps. &lt;strong&gt;Exploring and learning is what is celebrated.&lt;/strong&gt; Under no condition can mistakes be punished or made a point of shame. Without feeling safe about errors and unknowns, smallifying and creative learning is almost impossible. It will take time for most students to trust this environment, thus initially, expect students to be reluctant to smallify in order to explore all the unknowns inherent in big messy goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the next workable step happens as the student progresses - students are not working from a large, clear plan that maps out each step at the beginning of the project. I do give students who have never worked this way a few introductory steps to get them started.  Once underway, students gain confidence and generally have enough experience to find the next workable step - as they progress. Here’s a concrete example of smallifying, based on building a racing catamaran that is stable while turning at speed might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configure your computer with the software to print on a 3-D printer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design and print a box (or any simple shape);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;print the above shape, but make it hollow (learn to subtract a shape);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;print the above hollowed shape joined with a second shape; if the first shape is a box, add a cone, sphere, pyramid, etc (this requires addition and translation);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc. (now the students have enough basics to keep learning and progressing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Bill Rankin said in several keynote addresses, you learn to cook by cooking. In fact, you learn almost anything by doing it. You have to jump in and start, or “get cooking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a student who chooses to build a rescue boat will have a different set of small steps, but common to both boats is learning to work incrementally and building on the next workable small step toward the goal. This is a powerful learning technique that builds confidence in students&#39; ability to learn and be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the students get the hang of this process of moving from the big picture, identifying a few critical aspects, and smallifiying their project into small workable steps, they have effectively learned how to learn and self-correct as they move toward a large complex goal. This meta-aspect of the learning process and its deliberate practice may in the long run be a lifeworthy skill that goes far beyond the specific content of a single class. Engineering classes such as the Boat Design class example here work well. So, too, do classes in art and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution:&lt;/strong&gt; Smallification happens in &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt; chunks (one or two steps at a time maximum). In the tech world we call this planning at the last responsible moment, but fundamentally, it is about figuring out the next workable thing when the students have enough information to see that next step. This prevents the feeling that the big goal is just too overwhelming. Students who have never worked this way will need some smallifying guidance. For example, in the Boat Design class, I gave students a few steps to get started and I give the details of the final assessment. (I like a public demonstration and company pitch.)  As a teacher you may want to step through a project to be more confident in the timing, practice the smallifying, etc, but be careful not to give away more than needed and avoid at all costs big and detailed plans! The fun and exploration is a central feature of a motivating and educational experience for the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, creating a learning environment where having the big picture and exploring the details along the way can create an uplifting educational journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rework through Deliberate Practice</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_rework/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 15:01:22 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_rework/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good learning projects (quite possibly all interesting projects), must have the right amount of complexity and built-in imperfections due to design trade-offs and compromises. This ensures that projects aren’t google-able AND are challenging enough to encourage real learning. I like to think that “challenging enough” ensures that students experience a sense of the “hero’s journey” while working on their projects and then when they are successful they will have a sense of pride in what they learned and accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of complexity has two side effects that are common in the real world, but uncommon in education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to arrive at the best solution is unknown and uncertain (by even the teacher) and will require exploration - quite possibly there is more than one workable solution; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the process of exploring to find a workable solution will involve what is commonly called the dreaded deadend or, in my field of tech, going down the rabbit hole. Unfortunately, this is often seen as a problem - not knowing and not understanding is, after all, what schools set out to correct. Allowing students to head in the wrong direction, especially since many people value efficiency (for example, discovering the fastest way to learn), can seem wrong-headed, but schools in theory should value worthwhile learning as their top priority, not speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, as students work, they self-assess, self-reflect, and self-correct their own work. It is, unfortunately, very common that we as teachers correct students and we as teachers tell them not only what to rework, and how to do it. This may be efficient at getting certain results - for example, completed projects. However, I question if that is valuable learning. When we judge student work, students learn to work toward the approval found in a grade, which alters learning. Additionally, when we tell students what to do, they don’t learn to self-regulate and self-motivate their own learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when students can engage in &lt;strong&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/strong&gt; (where they self-assess, self-reflect, self-correct, and choose to &lt;strong&gt;redo&lt;/strong&gt; until they themselves are satisfied), then students not only learn the classroom curriculum, but also lifeworthy skills, including: problem solving skills, balancing competing design needs, grit (stick-to-it-ive-ness), self-directed learning, and the joy of learning and discovery. In this way, students are much more likely to become life-long learners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that students learn the process of &lt;strong&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/strong&gt;, it is important to create a classroom environment where it is straightforward for students to be able to self-assess. I have found the best way to do this is to use &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; assessments&lt;/strong&gt;. At least in the world of code, engineering, and physics, this is pretty straightforward. Make rubrics in which the students can test themselves, e.g. in a class making boats, the rubric will ask if it floats with a payload, say a large coin. For areas where natural assessment isn’t as easy, I teach the kids how to get (and give) each other helpful feedback (described in a later article). In this way, students are helping each other, learning from each other, and in the end self-assessing what to do with the feedback. They are no longer as reliant on the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of letting students learn this way, when there is safety to explore &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;(&amp;amp; make mistakes)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, is that the students often enjoy the learning, gain self-confidence, and possibly learn the &lt;strong&gt;JOY&lt;/strong&gt; of learning. If this joy of learning becomes commonplace in education, we are very likely to have many more joyful, lifelong learners and innovators.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploration in the Classroom</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_exploration/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 16:57:16 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_exploration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fun and a sense of adventure can be crucial to classroom engagement and learning. Cultivating a sense of adventure is similar to encouraging an atmosphere of playfulness and joy of learning. This can be quite straightforward when students are allowed to create their own goals and their own context for the goals within the curriculum. Of course, any good adventure can’t be too easy. It’s the teacher’s job to make sure a project has no obvious, googleable answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might worry that making the project hard and beyond what the students know how to do could be unfair or even unjust. This might be true. When students are used to the mindset of getting things right the first time, it is difficult for them to take an idea and ‘play’ with it until something works. This adjustment takes some time, but once they get the hang of it, students enjoy exploring and they learn quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I most enjoy  observing how students learn resilience through ‘playing’ with ideas and trying different options until they find a solution. In fact, in today’s world it may be more important to learn resilience, persistence, and finding the next small workable step in order to progress toward a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course creating an environment where exploration can thrive requires not doing a few things, too - such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not judging or criticizing mistakes or rework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not judging the work or its qualities, instead let the kids cultivate their own pride and ownership (the minimum quality tests need clear, objective and observable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not celebrating the answers, but celebrating the exploratory and learning aspects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not requiring that every student have the same depth of knowledge in each part of the project. It&amp;rsquo;s important to define baseline knowledge they all need to have - but after that they need to be free to explore more deeply what the student finds interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage exploration we have found that the following the guidance for a growth mindset is very helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praise the grit and perseverance of arriving at a workable solution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate the mindset of finding the next workable thing to try, even when there is no clear path to the goal; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage / expect (maybe even require) rework and changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a practical note, it is important to create projects that are complex and have some built-in conflict that requires balancing and tradeoffs. This is important for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without trade-offs, a problem isn’t realistic and can be too easily googled.  The problem must be challenging enough or it isn’t engaging (but it needs to be workable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having to resolve a conflict or resolve tradeoffs and still arrive at one&amp;rsquo;s goals requires students to really go into depth and learn that aspect extra well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; In the world of engineering, it is important to have a solid generalist understanding of the field (like the basic required information tested at school), but that is rarely enough for most teams. It is important to be a specialist in at least one area of interest &amp;ndash; these are called ‘T’ shaped engineers - engineers that have gone deep into two areas are even more valuable and are called ‘π’ shaped engineers. I’m advocating for creating projects (and classroom environments) in school that cultivate the same generalist / specialist mindset that is often expected in graduate school and professional lives. Art curriculums have long taught the core skills and ideas and then expected students to explore and expand upon their interests. Imagine how engaging education could be when all aspects of schools encouraged choice and exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching this way can be uncomfortable for teachers who may traditionally have felt that they need to operate as the expert who knows everything. To model the idea, however, that you don’t have to know everything, it is actually helpful not to know everything. In fact, you cannot give students a quick answer, which cuts off their chance to think through the problem, and instead you explore with the students and model how to learn and resolve difficult problems. The teacher must simply understand the basics and vocabulary of the field to help students interpret what they find.  Of course the teacher must also be comfortable modeling exploring the unknown with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
