      <title>EDgility - Encouraging Agency and Collaboration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collaboration leads to good things! When Bill (IT and education) and Paul (education and summer camp) began informing their teaching with Agile, a fresh take on some common educational practices emerged. Together they looked with outsider/insider perspectives at collaboration, exploration, student agency, and doing school in uplifting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What emerged is (EDgility)[https://edgility.school], a set of practices anyone can use to nudge their teaching in the direction of greater student engagement, shared control of decision making, and practice of highly transferable skills. Bill and Paul discuss how they arrived at the practices of EDgility, using an example of one of Bill’s middle school classes, a STEM class on nautical design, what the school referred to as “the boat class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think you’ll enjoy the practical advice, based on a real world example, to strengthen your ability to shift learning to the learner, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
