      <title>Feedback: It&#39;s Not what You Think</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/explore_uplift_feedback/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do what I can to create an environment where students can learn as much as possible both independently and from each other collaboratively. This has two large impacts. First, as a teacher I am mostly removed from continually correcting students. Second, as a teacher I have time to coach and guide the students when they need help and guidance, in a manner they are asking for. Teaching is much more joyful when you aren’t continually in a position of correcting  and judging what is right. The classroom atmosphere is positively impacted as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote independent learning I do what I can to create learning situations (and projects) where &lt;strong&gt;natural&lt;/strong&gt; feedback is integral to the learning process. Natural feedback comes about in circumstances where the student work itself produces the feedback with no dependence on the teacher. For example, while learning about designing boats, if students are printing their designs on a 3D printer, the students themselves will see how their boats float and how they react to adverse conditions, for example waves and wind. If the assignment asks students to test their boats by setting up a fan to blow across the test pool, they will see if their boat can travel across the pool without hitting the side wall or foundering. Or in math and physics students can do what we call sanity checks. Are their calculations plausible? Learning the skill of creating and learning from feedback that you control yourself is a transferable, life-worthy skill, that goes beyond the particular content of an activity or course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote collaborative learning, I help students learn how to support each other by giving feedback that is easy to digest. Instead of promoting correction, I ask students to follow the Pixar &lt;strong&gt;additive&lt;/strong&gt; feedback method (see the resources at the end for further information). In short, I have the following demo or presentation rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;feedback giver&lt;/strong&gt;: 1) stop and think, then 2) start with what you like and 3) say what you would like to see more of. There is no corrective feedback or discussions of what you dislike. Students (and the teacher) just offer what they would like to see more of. It’s ok, of course, if that feedback excludes some of what’s there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;demo presenter&lt;/strong&gt;: 1) listen and 2) do not comment or or mount a defense to what you are hearing, but clarification questions are allowed and encouraged. After the demo, (3) stop and think; then (4) decide what suggestions to act upon and what not to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students (and many teachers) are not very practiced at Pixar’s &lt;strong&gt;additive feedback&lt;/strong&gt;, so practice is practice is essential.  In fact, initially I guide all demos to ensure they learn the practices to feel safe while demoing, giving and getting additive feedback.  After demos I do a quick reflection with the group to help them think through what ideas to use and what to disregard.  Over time, the students get good at this and I no longer guide the demos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; feedback isn&amp;rsquo;t easy or when working with technical topics where there are multiple ways to solve a problem and when judgement is important. Then instead of emphasizing &amp;lsquo;additive&amp;rsquo; feedback, I turn to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.michaelagreiler.com/about/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Michaela Greiler (Doctor McKayla)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;code review guidelines&lt;/strong&gt; in her video 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.michaelagreiler.com/respectful-constructive-code-review-feedback/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Respectful, Constructive Code-Review Feedback&lt;/a&gt;.  She developed these guidelines while working at Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Research and Development Department while studying the effects of code reviews and feedback on team performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I avoid the phrase &amp;ldquo;constructive feedback,&amp;rdquo; since that phrase is too often code for stating what you personally think is correct. When the teacher does that, from the position of power granted to teachers by way of assigning grades, for example, constructive feedback becomes another way to tell students what is right (according to the teacher) and what students should do. Encouraging additive feedback puts the focus on what the student is learning, not what the teacher is thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that collaborative feedback is practiced I require every project to include at least one adjustment that students must credit to another student’s feedback when they hand-in or present their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technology companies focus on communication and feedback to create an environment of enthusiastic, engaged learners.  Fundamentally, they are moving away from an &amp;lsquo;authoritative&amp;rsquo;,  &amp;lsquo;telling&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;corrective&amp;rsquo; approach and instead toward an &amp;lsquo;amplifying&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;curious&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;collaborative&amp;rsquo; approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Value: Motivation and Knowledge with a Context</title>
      <link>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_value/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 14:05:18 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://btihen.me/post_edu/edgility_btihen_value/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to find ways to make the topic of study valuable - not to me, but to the students. I actually usually find that value requires a context or integration. If an engineer builds a more efficient transport boat, but the boat regularly sinks when sailing in wind, then the boat has little value despite its newly engineered efficiency. Similarly, student learning proceeds with value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I have found students will cultivate their own value when they have a choice in how they approach and apply the learning associated with a subject. In particular, students will find value when they can define their own goal consistent with the class agenda and ideally within a context that is valuable or interesting to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I encourage students to pick their own learning goals within the open guidelines of the class. I generally ask them to choose their own backstory and context for each subject. For many teachers - and possibly for you, the readers - this may sound silly or like a waste of time. However, creating a backstory and context has many beneficial side effects: a) students have a goal that they chose themselves; b) students have their own context - many teenagers seem to enjoy creating a new experimental identity); and c) students research the broad aspects of a topic and to figure out what is most important in the areas that they find attractive. At this point, assuming the students have the feeling that they will be supported and can accomplish their goal, they have acquired their own value and context for the material and the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This startup process includes the students learning some background about what they are learning without violating the principle of “cooking from day one.” Teenagers, if not overwhelmed by the idea, enjoy picking their own goals and exercising their indepence. As teachers, it is important to be flexible enough to allow goals that might be outside our teacher expectations, especially if the outcomes are valuable and still fit, perhaps more widely interpreted, with the learning goals of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, startup with choice is not quite enough. It’s not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students must go deep enough in a subject so that they discover viable, but  competing, answers to the problems they are working on, so that they can explain why their solutions are defendable within their chosen context. For example, while collaborating with a biology teacher, we decided to combine biology and robotics and have the students build their own mini-robot gardeners to care for their plants over a three week holiday. A few students chose what they believed was the best watering strategy, but they didn’t anticipate that the cleaning staff would  move their equipment during the break. The ensuing jiggling dislodged a few sensors, and some plants were flooded with water and drowned. Upon return they learned that “best” is only best if it includes planning for failures. We could have explained planning for failure to the students, but the natural consequences of a flood was a much better teacher and the real world consequences much more memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it is important to help ensure that students learn within a context with enough complexity so they learn to choose between multiple possible answers that will each have different strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many students are not yet accustomed to the expectation of learning enough about a topic so that they understand its complexity and the context for when it is valuable and when it is not. Therefore, initially, it is usually helpful to have them work through small challenges in a supportive, low risk situation where mistakes and exploration is safe and expected. This creates an uplifting environment where learning is enjoyable and self-motivating. Without uplift, the engagement of value and self-motivation is challenging and the need for judgement increases (and starts a vicious cycle). See the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://peakchallenges.ch/blog/edgility_pmagnuson_uplift&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Uplift blog&lt;/a&gt; for a further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depth of knowledge gained when students choose between viable alternatives they have discovered themselves seems surprisingly under-emphasized in schools, since in the professional world this is a basic expectation. We expect our bridges and buildings to do well in earthquakes, high winds, and high water while they also serve our daily needs well. We expect doctors to advise us or pick the best medication, based on our age, sickness, our expectation of quality of life during treatment. We can perhaps leverage value to expect more of our students, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning value within a context is a very important life skill - not just an important academic skill.&lt;/p&gt;
